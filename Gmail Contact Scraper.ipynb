    "# Extracting Data from Email Signatures\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of useful information in email signatures. Let’s see if we can extract it and put it to work for our customers. The good news is that a lot of the work has been done and open sourced.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "A guy named Inder Singh wrote a blog post about how he did this using some Java components. You can read here:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://inder-gnu.blogspot.com/2013/09/extracting-email-signatures-and-mining.html\n",
    "\n",
    "I took a stab at finding the relevant components in the Python world.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding the Signature\n",
    "\n",
    "Our friends at Mailgun have a cool library called Talon that we can use. It uses machine learning techniques to reliably extract the signature.\n",

    "### Email addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily we start out with the email address in the From header. That may be all we need. But let’s look for other email addresses using regex. Here's a site I found with some examples\n",
    "\n",
    "http://emailregex.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: there are a lot of developers who get enraged at the idea of using regexes to find email addresses because they are not 100% perfect. Do not succumb co this line of thinking - we are not looking for perfection. If we can identify >90% of email addresses in signatures it will be a thrilling success for most of our users.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python regex: r\"(^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$)\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Phone Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the port of Google's libphonenumber library, which sounds like it works very well according to the blog post.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/daviddrysdale/python-phonenumbers\n",
    " \n",
    "Left to us is the determination of Work vs. Mobile vs. Other\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------Page 1-----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linked In\n",
    "\n",
    "A regex should work here as well Perhaps a 2 step combo of first looking for URLs and then parsing them and detecting whether one has a linked.com domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Twitter\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a Python port of Twitter's Twitter Text library:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/edburnett/twitter-text-python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Address\n",

    "Not surprisingly, this is going to be thornier. Here's an interesting look at the hopelessness of getting a perfect algorithm-.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.mjt.me.uk/posts/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-addresses/\n",
    "\n",
    "But once again, let's not get too concerned about perfection. If we can get >90\\% our customers will call it a big win.\n",
