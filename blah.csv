18,here is a photograph of a similar house.  the dimensions would be 56'wide x 41' deep for the living area.  in addition there will be a 6' deep two story porch across the entire back and 30' across the front.  a modification to the front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.  the living area will be brought forward under this gable to be flush with the front porch.
